            <h3>Professional Short Bio</h3>
            <p>I am flexible, reliable and possess excellent time keeping skills. I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated,
                reliable, responsible and hard working person. I am a mature team worker and adaptable to all
                challenging
                situations. I am able to work well both in a team environment as well as using own
                initiative.Relationship
                is not about having a handsome boyfriend or having a beautiful girlfriend. It is not about looking for a
                perfect because there is not perfect person on earth. It is not about looking for a well off or rich
                person.
                Money cannot buy love. A relationship is finding someone who respects you, who cares about you, who
                understands you, who is proud of having you, who loves the way you are, who is faithful to you, and who
                knows how to comfort you.</p> <br>

            <h3>Become A Web-Developer</h3>
            <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless
                information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.Not
                everyone deserves you. so protect your energy for something better. Everyone wants happiness but nobody
                wants pain. you cannot have a rainbow without little rain. Don't wait for things to get easier, better,
                life will always be complicated. Learn to be happy right now. Otherwise,you will run out of time.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero</p> <br>
