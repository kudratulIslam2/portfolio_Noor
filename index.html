            <h3>Professional Short Bio</h3>
            <p>I am flexible, reliable and possess excellent time keeping skills. I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated,
                reliable, responsible and hard working person. I am a mature team worker and adaptable to all
                challenging
                situations. I am able to work well both in a team environment as well as using own
                initiative.Relationship
                is not about having a handsome boyfriend or having a beautiful girlfriend. It is not about looking for a
                perfect because there is not perfect person on earth. It is not about looking for a well off or rich
                person.
                Money cannot buy love. A relationship is finding someone who respects you, who cares about you, who
                understands you, who is proud of having you, who loves the way you are, who is faithful to you, and who
                knows how to comfort you.</p> <br>
